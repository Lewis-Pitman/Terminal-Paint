# Paint
 Painting program in terminal written in C++. Only works on Windows. 
 
 **To install,** download the exe file from the releases tab. It is recommended you place the exe in it's own folder, e.g. "Terminal paint", so that you can easily access the "TPAINT files" and "BMP exports" folders it makes.

 # Features
 - Export created images to the BMP format
 - Save and load files from the proprietary "TPAINT" format
 - Ability to resize the image's dimensions (May encounter unexpected results when width and height don't match. I believe this might be a terminal bug as it appears correctly when exporting)
 - Line tool
 - Fill tool
